    description: `This case explores how institutions can expand institutionally supported resilience work to security officers and other front-line staff. It models how to gather information, pilot some initial programs, and use information from the pilot to develop more regular programming. It takes into account shift work, the need for 24/7 coverage, and the importance of compensating staff for engaging in these efforts. The centrality of cross-unit collaboration and relationship building is central.`,
    objectives: [`Consider how to expand, revise, or change existing staff resilience models for a population of staff typically excluded from them.`, `Model how to work across units in a complex organization to gather and pilot programming ideas before confirming a regular cadence of offerings.`,`Demonstrate the importance of staff feedback, especially related to logistics, for resilience work.`, `Expand awareness about the range of staff who can benefit from resilience work and the types of challenges the schedule and content of their work includes.`,`Reflect on the role of chaplains and spiritual care providers in these processes.`, `Consider how to fund and support these efforts as part of annual operational budgets so they are ongoing.` ],
    themes: [`Current and future leaders of complex organizations including healthcare, higher education, non-profit and for-profit organizations.`, `Note: This case draws strongly from Costello, Zorina et al. 2023. “Resilience Program for Hospital Security Officers During the COVID-19 Pandemic Using a Community Engagement Model.” Journal of Community Health. Dec;48(6):963-969. doi: 10.1007/s10900-023-01282-w.`],
