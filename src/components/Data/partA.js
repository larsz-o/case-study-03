Do you think we should even hold one?”</p>

      <p>Another chaplain chimes in, “I agree that it’s clear that Mario was suffering, but it still does not feel right to hold a memorial service for him.

    question: `<p>A week after the incident, the hospital stopped to observe a moment of silence. Weeks later, a group of staff came together to plan a physical monument, a memorial, for the campus in honor of those who died. While some people thought such a monument was unhealthy - a visible reminder of what happened - most staff were supportive.</p>
<p>However, there was not consensus around what form the monument should take, or where it should go.</p>
<p>Dr. Hendel delegated responsibility for this effort to a small group including staff from Facilities, Spiritual Care, and Public Safety. Questions about whether there would be an annual memorial service at the monument or elsewhere and how it would be marked were core to these discussions.</p>

<p>Once again, you were part of the group that shaped these decisions.</p><p>You convene with the group to discuss the monument. The Facilities representative opens the meeting by asking where the monument should be placed. The Public Safety representative suggests placing it at the site of the shooting. The Facilities representative agrees, then turns to you and asks you what you think.</p>       <p>How do you respond?</p>`,

  question: `<p>It was some time before progress was made on a permanent monument, an outdoor garden with a pond and benches located some distance from the crime scene. The names of the victims were not included. Unless they know the history, visitors today would not connect it to the events of April 16, 2009. The monument was dedicated one year after the incidents on April 16, 2010.</p><p>Services of remembrance were held to mark the date in 2011 and 2012 and then there was debate about what to do. Many employees had been hired since the event and had no direct connection to it; some people felt strongly that it was maudlin to continue to mark the anniversary, that the hospital needed to “move on.” </p>

<p>Others still felt an emotional connection and active grief and wanted the opportunity to mark the dates in community.</p> 

<p>Your supervisor, the Director of Spiritual Care, met with Dr. Hendel to discuss plans for the future. You were invited to join the meeting since you were so involved in planning memorial services and the monument.</p><p>You sit down in Dr. Hendel’s office beside your supervisor. She expresses that she’s anxious about the debate that these services are causing amongst the hospital community. She turns to you both and says, “I don’t know, what do you think we should do? Should we just cancel these services?”</p>

<p>How should you respond?</p>

    question: `<h3>A compromise</h3><p>Dr. Hendel liked your idea. The compromise by year four was to have a Day of Peace observed on April 16th. The Director of Spiritual Care sent a flier and notice to all staff, and a harpist played in the lobby from 11 am - 1pm, encompassing the time of the full event. This provided a way for those who wanted to participate to have something, but it was not so large as to create new trauma.</p>`,
